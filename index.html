<h2>What is Quick Code Diff? 🤔</h2>
<p>Quick Code Diff is a tool that helps you quickly compare two pieces of code, highlighting added, removed, and unchanged lines, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<h2>Features 🎊</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compare two pieces of code side-by-side, with added lines in green, removed lines in red, and unchanged lines in black</li>
<li>Preserves newline characters, because we care about the little things</li>
<li>Runs locally, no server dependencies, because we love freedom</li>
<li>Highlights added, removed, and unchanged lines, because we love rainbows</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started 🚀</h2>
<ol>
<li>Save this repository to your local machine</li>
<li>Run <code>python start_server.py</code> to start the server</li>
<li>Open a web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;</code> (replace <code>&lt;port&gt;</code> with the port number displayed in the terminal)</li>
<li>Paste your code into the two textareas and click "Compare" to see the diff</li>
</ol>
<h2>How it Works 🧙‍♂️</h2>
<p>The tool uses the Diff library to compute the differences between the two pieces of code. The differences are then highlighted in the output, with added lines in green, removed lines in red, and unchanged lines in black.</p>
